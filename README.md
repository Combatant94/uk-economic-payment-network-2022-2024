Hey, I’m **Mohd Nafees** – MSc Data Science graduate from Birkbeck, University of London.  
This project started with a simple question:  
> *Who actually pays whom across UK industries?*

So I grabbed real data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and went digging

<sub><em>Each circle represents an industry; the brighter the node, the higher its influence in the UK economy.</em></sub>

Between 2022 and 2024, almost **£4 trillion** moved between sectors.  
I treated every industry as a node, every transaction as a connection — and built a network to see which sectors drive the economy.

### 💡 Highlights
- **Core + Connectors** (manufacturing, logistics, retail): handle **85%+ of daily transactions**  
- **Finance sector**: controls the network despite <10% of flow — **63% of systemic influence**  
- **Peripheral sectors**: small players (care, arts, local services) — but essential for stabilit
That gap between *money flow* and *network power* was eye-opening.

<p align="center"><sub><em>
Each line represents an industry cluster derived from PCA + K-Means.  
Cluster 3 (red): Core & Financial sectors – drive most of the UK’s trade volume and influence.  
Cluster 2 (green): Connectors – retail, logistics, and construction industries supporting national flow.  
Cluster 1 (orange): Bridge sectors – moderate trade volume but high betweenness, linking major groups.  
Cluster 0 (blue): Peripheral industries – care, arts, and local services that stabilize the system.

## 🔧 How I Built It (End-to-End Workflow)
	1.	📊 Data Collection

Downloaded official ONS datasets:
	•	ukindustrytoindustrypaymentflowsjanuary2017tonovember2024final.xlsx
	•	publisheduksicsummaryofstructureworksheet.xlsx
	
  2.	🧹 Data Cleaning & Mapping
Cleaned and mapped SIC codes in Python (pandas, numpy), saved as:
	•	industry_transactions_final_typed.csv
	•	industry_clusters_stable.csv
	
  3.	🧠 Network & Clustering Analysis
Built economic networks (NetworkX), computed centralities & ran K-Means + PCA
→ Notebook: notebooks/UK_paymnet_flows.ipynb

  4.	🗃️ SQL Modelling
Created Fact and Dimension tables from cleaned data
→ SQL File: sql/uk_industry_payments_analysis.sql
	
  5.	📈 Power BI Visualization
Built dashboard with DAX measures (flows, clusters, systemic influence)
→ Published interactive version on NovyPro (link below)
	
  6.	📝 Report
Combined visuals & findings into final report:
→ report/UK_payment_flows_Report.pdf

### 🚀 Live Dashboard.
🎥 Explore the Interactive Dashboard: *(Coming soon – will be published on [NovyPro](https://www.novypro.com/) shortly)*  

Below is a preview image from the Power BI dashboard built with DAX measures and ONS trade data.

## Run This Project Yourself
### 🧭 How to Run

1. Clone the repo  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Combatant94/uk-economic-payment-network-2022-2024.git
   Create database
   CREATE DATABASE uk_industry_payments;
   Import CSVs and run queries from
   sql/uk_industry_payments_analysis.sql
   
2.	Open the Jupyter notebook (UK_paymnet_flows.ipynb)
3.	Unzip industry_transactions_final_typed.csv.zip before loading
4.	Run the SQL script to create the database and tables
5.	Open Power BI dashboard (if available) to explore visual insights
